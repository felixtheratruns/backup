This bash script backs up folders to multiple directories using rysnc. It also has a menu option that gets rid of characters in paths that cause problems with rsync.

edit the source and destination directories in vars.sh and run with:
sudo ./backup.sh

It will display the source and destinations and ask you to confirm if you want to continue.
